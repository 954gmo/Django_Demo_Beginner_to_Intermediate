# Customizing Forms
most common customization
1. adding media(JavaScript and CSS) to a form to change its apperance
2. Replacing form field widgets with another built-in widget, or a custom widget you've created
3. Adding rich-text editing capability to forms in the front end.

# Adding Media to Forms
add a Media inner class to the form class. 

Django stores the forms' media declarations in the media attribute of the form class,

which we're accessing via the form.media template variable. 

the media URL is relative to your STATIC_URL setting. 

```python
# forms.py
class VenueForm(ModelForm):
    required_css_class = 'required'
    class Meta:
        model = Venue
        fields = '__all__'
        widgets = {
            'name': MyFormWidget(attrs={'class': 'mywidget'}),
            'address': Textarea(attrs={'cols': 40, 'rows': 3}),
        }

    class Media:
        css = {
            'all': ('form.css',)
        }
        js = ('mycustom.js',)

    def clean(self):
        cleaned_data = super().clean()
        phone = cleaned_data.get("phone")
        email_address = cleaned_data.get("email_address")
        if not (phone or email_address):
            raise forms.ValidationError(
                "You must enter either a phone number or an email, or both."
                )

```
```html
<!--base.html-->
<!-- .... -->
<head>
   {% block styles %} {% endblock styles %} 
</head>
<!-- .... -->

<!--add_venue.html-->
{% extends 'base.html'%}
...
{%block styles %} {{ form.media }} {% endblock styles %}
...
```

# Custom Widgets
you can customize individual form fields by changing the default widget to a built-in widget or to a custom widget you create.

Django's form widgets are simple objects-- each is associated with a small HTML template taht renders as an HTML form element. 

`venv\Lib\site-packages\django\forms\templates\django\forms\widgets`

creating a custom widget is as easy as adding custom styling and functions
to an existing widget.
