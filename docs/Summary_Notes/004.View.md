```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
urlpatterns = [
    path('/<int:year>/<str:month>/', views.index, name='index')
]

# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from datetime import date
# by using default argument, when not passing the year and month to the index 
# function, avoid throwing error. 
def index(request, year=date.today().year, month=date.today().month):
    return HttpResponse()
```

# views
`views` decide what data get delivered to the template, either by acting on input from the user or in response to other business logic and internal process

each view performs a specific function and has an associated template. 

represented by either a Python function of class

function views and class-based views

configuring the URLs
having all URLs in one file is more complex and less portable, 
but it can lead to strange behavior if two applications use a view with the same name
create a new urls.py for each application
- site-wide navigation: 
- app-wide navigation

you should always name your URLs, so that they can be referred to in code(reverse lookup), 
URL reversing is common in both templates and views, 

# How Django works
Every Django application follows this same basic process each time it receives a request from the browser. 
1. Client sent message to server requesting it return content located at the URL
2. Django then looked for a URL pattern matching the request, 
by first searching the sites level urls.py, and then each of the apps for an urls.py file 
containing a pattern that matches.
3. Once Django match a URL, the request is sent to the associated view
4. the view then renders the message to a HttpResponse adn sends it to client
5. the client renders the response and user see the effect.



# Creating View: Dynamic Content
```python
# views.py

# This code can live anywhere you want, as long as itâ€™s on your Python path.
# but it is usually place in a file named views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
import datetime


# each view function takes an HttpRequest object as its first parameter, 
# you can name it anything, but it is typically named request
def current_datetime(request):
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    html = f"<html><body>Time: {now}</body></html>"
    return HttpResponse(html)

```
# Path converter
path converters are equivalent to capturing groups
path converters are an easy to understand and simple to code method for capturing URL arguments.
However, when you need a more robust option for validating URLs, Django also provides regular expression matching for URLs
<type:variable>
there are five different path converter types:
1. str - matches any non-empty string, excluding '/'.
2. path - matches any non-empty string, including '/', useful for matching the entire URL
3. int - matches an integer
4. slug - matches any slug string
5. UUID - matches a universally unique identifier

/<int:year>/<str:month>/


# Mapping URLs to Views
URLs configuration is like a table of contents 

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    # uncomment this for admin
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),

    path('time/', views.current_datetime), 
]

```

the main thing to note here is the `urlpatterns`, 
Django expects to find in 
`settings.py` : `ROOT_URLCONF = '<project>.urls'`

the `ROOT_URLCONF` tells Django which python module should be used as the URL configuration for this web site


# How Django Processes a Request

`python manage.py runserver` imports `settings.py`, which contains all sorts of optional configuration for this particular Django instance

when a request comes in, Django loads the URL configuration pointed to by the `ROOT_URLCONF` setting. 

Then it checks each of the URL patterns in that URL configuration in order,  comparing the requested URL with the patterns one at a time, 
until it finds one that matches. 

When it finds a match, it calls the view function associated with that pattern, passing an `HttpRequest` object as the first parameter to the function

the view function is responsible for returning an `HttpResponse` object. 


## Complete Detail
1. HTTP request comes in from browser
2. a server-specific `handler` construct the `HttpRequest` object, and pass to later components and handles the flow of the response processing
3. the handler calls any available *Request/View middleware* , 
these types of middleware are useful for augmenting incoming `HttpRequest` objects
as well as providing special handling for specific types of requests, 
if either returns an `HttpResponse`, processing bypasses the view.
4. if `view` raises an `exception`, control passes to the `Exception middleware`, 
5. `response middleware` post-process an `HttpResponse` just before it's sent to teh browser

# Dynamic URLs (passing parameters in the URL, not using ?q=&...)
In most dynamic web app, a URL contains parameters that influence the output of the page. 
using regular expression in urls
`re_path`

coding order, URL patterns first, and the view second
or view first and patterns second, either works. 


```python
# pay attention here, the name 'offset' in the path, should the same as in the function view
# urls.py
path('time/ahead/<int:offset>'), 
re_path(r'^time/plus/(\d{1,2})/$'), must use () to group the regex pattern

# views.py

# offset is the string captured in the URLpattern, 
def hours_ahead(request, offset):
    dt = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(hours=offset)
    html = f"<html><body>In {offset} hour(s), it will be {dt} </body></html>"
    return HttpResponse(html)
```


# Advanced Views and URL configurations

url configuration tricks

special-casing URLs in Debug Mode

```python
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += [
        path('path/', <view>)
    ]
```

# keyword arguments vs. Positional argument
```python
def sell(item, price, quantity):
    print(item, price, quantity)

sell(item, price, quantity)
sell(item=item, price=price, quantity=quantity)
```

passing extra options to view functions

including other URL configuration

# Generic Views
They take certain common idioms and patterns found in view development and abstract them so that you can quickly write 
common views of data without having to write too much code. 

generic views perform common 'simple' tasks: redirect to a different page and render a given template
display list and detail pages for a single object
