# using Django's Error Page(using assert False and Django's error page)
- at the top of the page, you get the key information about the exception: 
the type of exception, any parameters to the exception, the file in which the exception
was raised and the offending line number
- Under the key exception information, the page displays the full Python traceback for this exception.

# Using the Messages Framework
By default, the messages framework will only add messages at INFO level or higher, 

so we need to make some tweaks

```python
# settings.py
from django.contrib.messages import constants as message_constants

if DEBUG:
    MESSAGE_LEVEL = message_constants.DEBUG
else:
    MESSAGE_LEVEL = message_constants.INFO
```

# Unit Testing
Unit Testing is based on four fundamental concepts:
1. A test fixture is the setup needed to perform tests. 
This could include databases, sample datasets and server setup.
A test fixture  may also include any clean-up actions required after tests have been performed
2. A test case is the basic unit of testing. A test case checks whether a given set of inputs 
leads to an expected set of results.
3. A test suite is a number of test cases, or other test suites, that are executed as a group
4. A test runner is the software program that controls the execution of tests and feeds the results  of tests
back to the user.

# Testing Views
```python
from django.test import Client
client = Client()
respose = client.get('/get/url/')
```
