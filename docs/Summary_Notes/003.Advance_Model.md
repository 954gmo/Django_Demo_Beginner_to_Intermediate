# Model Managers
> A Manager is a Django class that provides the interface between database query operations and a Django model.
> 
> Each Django model is provided with a default Manager named `objects`.
> 
> you can customize the default Manager class by extending the base Manager class for the model, the two most common use-cases
> 1. Adding Extra Manager Methods
> 2. Modifying initial QuerySet results.
>
> Extra manager methods add table-level functionality to models. 
>
> Extra manager methods are created by inheriting the Manager base class 
> and adding custom functions to the custom Manager class.
>
> overriding initial manager QuerySets
> to change what is returned by the default manager queryset, you override the Manager.get_queryset() method. 
> 
> there is no limit to how many custom managers you can add to your model instance
> 
> Once it has been created, you can use your new manager method just like any other model method.

# Model Methods
> Django's Model class comes with many built-in methods, such as `save(), delete(), __str__()`
> 
> manager methods add table-level functionality to Django's models,
> 
> model methods add row-level functions that act on individual instances of the model.
>  
> There are two common cases where you want to play with model methods
> 
> - when you want to add business logic to the model by adding custom model methods
> 
> - when you want to override the default behavior of a built-in model method
> 

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

# Adding Extra model method
class TABLENAME_Manager(models.Manager):
    def something(self, var):
        return self.filter(field__icontains='laksjdf').count()

# Overriding Initial Manager QuerySets    
class TABLENAME_Manager_2(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super(TABLENAME_Manager_2, self).get_queryset().filter(fields_1 = 'sjafkld')
    
class TABLENAME(models.Model):
    field1 = models.CharField()

    # 
    # Model Manger 
    #
    objects = TABLENAME_Manager()
    # renaming the Default Model Manager
    # somename = TABLENAME_Manager()
    # 
    # then you can refer to the default manager like so: 
    # TABLENAME.somename.all()

    local_objects = TABLENAME_Manager_2()
    default_objects = models.Manager()
    
    #
    # Custom Model Methods
    # 
    def some_function(self, var):
        return 'something'

    # the property decorator allowing you to call the method without ()
    @property
    def name_slug(self):
        return self.field1.lower().replace(' ', '-')

    #
    # Overriding Default Model Methods
    # 
    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.field1 = 'sdkjf'
        # do something
        super(TABLENAME, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
``` 

# Model Inheritance
## Multi-table inheritance
> each model has its own database table
> the parent class is a normal model, and the child inherits the parent 
> by declaring the parent class in the child class declaration
> Database tables are created for both the parent and the child model
## Abstract base classes
> the parent model holds information common to all its child classes but doesn't have a database table. 
> Abstract base classes are handy when you want to put common information into other models without 
> having to create a database table for the base class.
> 
```python
from django.db import  models
class BASE(models.Model):
    field1 = models.CharField()
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True # making the class be a abstract base class

class SUB(BASE):
    def __str__(self):
        return self.field1

class SUB2(BASE):
    field2 = models.DateTimeField() 
```
