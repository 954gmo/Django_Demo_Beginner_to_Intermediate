# Understanding Django MVC 
![Django MVC stack](imgs\Django_MVC_stack.png)

> Django uses `HTTP` `request` and `response` objects to communicate between the `client` and `server`
> 
> The `view` retrieves data from the `database` via the `model`, 
> formats the data, wraps it up in an `HTTP response` object and sends it to the `client`
> That is, the `view` represents the `model` to the `client` as an `HTTP response`
> 
> With that said, if the function/class return a `Http response`, 
> it is a `view`, should be put it in the `views.py` or `views/`, otherwise, 
> it is an app logic, put it somewhere else.

# Architecture of Django Framework
![Django's Architecture](imgs\Django_architecture.png)

> The framework encapsulates the `model`, `view logic` and `business/app logic`
>
> `middleware` sits between the `view` and the `client`, performs critical security and authentication checks before sending the response to the client

# Structure of Django project
> Django provides a default way of doing things.
> 
> The fundamental unit of a Django web application is `project`, a project comprises one or more `apps`
> 
> An `app` is a self-contained package that should only do one thing, it allows you to add functionality to a Django
> project without interfering with other parts of the project, but apps are designed to be portable, 
> so you can use one app in multiple proejcts.
>
> 
> Django itself is a collection of apps, each designed to do one thing. 
> 
> Django's built-in apps, which are added to the project automatically, are invisible in your project tree, but can be seen in the `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settngs.py`, 
> 
> When adding apps to a Django project, add a link to the app configuration class to `INSTALLED_APPS`. 
> 
> When creating code that isn't a view, create a new Python module, when creating new modules for the Django project, consider scope.
> 
> project-level modules: more common and more portable, such as `manage.py`
> 
> site-level modules: should go in the same folder as `settings.py`

# URLconfs 
> Setup communication pathway that matches a request on the client-side with a project resource
> 
> Django use URL (Uniform Resources Locators) to match content with a request.
> 
> A URL configuration matches a unique URL with a project resource, not only a view.
> 
> A URL doesn't have to map to a view, it can map to any module in your app. 
> 
> Assuming your site address is http://www.example.com, the following URLconfs 
> (Note a URL doesn't have to map to a view)
> 
> `path('route1/', app1.<module/view>.<view_class.as_view/view_function/function>, name='sdjklfs')`
> 
> means: "when someone navigates to http://www.example.com/route1/, 
> run `app1.<module/view>.<view_class.as_view/view_function/function>`"
> 
> URLs configuration is like a table of contents
